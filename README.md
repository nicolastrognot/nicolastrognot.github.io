Hello everyone! My name is Nicolas TROGNOT and I am currently studying IT at EPITECH in Paris!


Here I am to publicize my work, you will find a summary of my projects below. Most of those projects were done at school (if you are at EPITECH, I advise you not to cheat by copying my works).

## C
[**PSU_2016_ftrace**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_ftrace) : ftrace is a program that allows an executable to be analyzed during execution. It will allow you to generate a call-graph, which will explain a program's execution flow in detail.

[**PSU_2016_malloc**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_malloc) : a project that consists of writing a library that contains the following functions: malloc, free and realloc. This library should be able to replace the system's corresponding functions, either by integrating them into the compilation or via an LD_PRELOAD.

[**PSU_2016_myftp**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_myftp) : a project that consists of writing a FTP server

[**PSU_2016_nmobjdump**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_nmobjdump) : the nm/objdump project will lead you to explore the ELF format, which is the format of the compiled files (executables, objects, static libraries, shared libraries) in a Unix environment.

[**PSU_2016_philo**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_philo) : the Dining philosophers problem (mini-project about threads)

[**PSU_2016_strace**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_strace) : strace is a program that allows all of the system calls used by a program to be retrieved. It will also allow you to gain a deeper understanding of the system call mechanism.

[**PSU_2016_lemipc**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C/PSU_2016_lemipc) : mini-project about the application of semaphores, message queues and segments of shared memory.


## C++
[**cpp_nanotekspice**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/C%2B%2B/cpp_nanotekspice) : the purpose of this project is to create a digital electronic simulator.



## OCAML
[**OCAML_2016_agenda**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/OCAML/OCAML_2016_agenda) : an agenda system that will allow you to save contacts and create appointments and events.

[**OCAML_2016_mylist**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/OCAML/OCAML_2016_mylist) : mylist consists of rewriting approximately twenty list handling functions. 

[**OCAML_2016_trainmanager**](https://github.com/nicolastrognot/nicolastrognot.github.io/tree/master/OCAML/OCAML_2016_trainmanager) : the Train Manager project consists of creating a train management system that allows you to organize trips between several stations, different types of trains, manage various conflicts (dates, times, platforms etc.), train station occupancy depending on the platform number, ...



## ASM
